If you easily give up you will rarely get what you need in life. Nothing great comes at the first approach, strike again to cross the border to success. People who easily give up don\'t get up. The proof of your desire for a favour is to persist in your request for it until you have it. Sometime the person you are asking for a favour may not want to give you-easily but your persistence can enforce you to have it. That proves your seriousness. Jacob persisted until he got the blessing. May you never give up in your pursuits until you get it, in the name of the Lord you will get your desire! Can I hear your Amen! \r\n(whatever you desire, pursue until you get it, disregard the cross for the crown)\r\nOur Prayer: Daddy, give me the grace to persist in my request until it is granted.

Why was God so interested in Jacob\'s success? Why did God shield Jacob from any hurt? And why did God enforce Jacob to return to his original inheritance? The answer to these is simply what I called THE POWER OF VOW. God\'s interest in Jacob\'s success was rooted in the vow that Jacob vowed to God in Gen. 28:20-22. Vow commits God exceptionally to your affair. He ensures your success and protection from external aggression. God also ensures you are back to your original favour if there is vow between you and him. If you find it difficult to succeed at anything you do, just try to make vow to God and see what will happen. Tell God, father if you do this for me I will honor you with this or that\" and watch what will happen, vow is a powerful key to unlock \r\nGod\'s favour. Try it today and seeâ€˜how God will commit himself to your course\r\n(vow has an enchanting force to provoke divine intervention in your unpleasant Circumstance)\r\nOur Prayer: Lord, as I vow to you today let my frustration come to an end over this issue.

Begging looks like a free gift you receive from people, but the reproach it carries could be very unappealing When you beg ,people use the opportunity to pour their grieves on you. And you have no choice than to listen since you begged them for something. Begging will make you lose your significance before the people. Begging keeps you at the mercy of people. It makes you a slave to the giver and crushes your sense of dignity. Once you are a beggar then you have no choice than to bear whatever insult people have to offer you. A beggar indeed has no choice! May you never be a beggar my God will give you the ability to work and have what you need to enjoy your life. Let whatever people give you be the reward of service rendered to them, thus, you will not be bound to men\'s reproach. You will not be a beggar anymore! \r\n(there is no certificate of honour for any beggar in life. donâ€™t settle for begging so you donâ€™t ruin your honour in life)\r\nOur Prayer: Father, give me your wisdom to work and earn my Living, let me never be a beggar at the mercy of people.

The original plan of God is for us to live an advanced fulfilled life.

Money is very easy to get, if only you know the secret of money. Money respects certain principles; let me share some with you. If you want to make money in life, have a needful product you can sell. Money doesn\'t come to people who are doing nothing but people doing something needful to humanity. If you can offer goods and services that are major necessities of life, you will make a lot of money where others are complaining of poverty. Joseph made a lot of money in the midst of famine. He had grains (food) which was a dare need, so he made money. It is my prayer for you, God will give you goods and services your environment need, and money will come to you immensely. You can\'t be poor if you have NEEDFUL GOODS AND SERVICES to offer.

Our money is used upâ€\r\nOur Focus: YOUR MONEY WILL NOT FINISH\r\nMoney is a dynamic force. It requires great wisdom to sustain money. If you lack wisdom, even, if you are given money you will still come back to poverty. If you don\'t know how to handle money, you will use it up. Money flows to people who do not spend everything that comes their ways.\r\nThey plough back some part of the money. Just as a farmer who does not eat up his whole harvest. He keeps some seed for replanting. Once you make money don\'t spend all try to invest. Honour God with your tithe, so He can grant you favour to make more money. Then buy things that can yield more money for you. Instead of using money for birthday or burial ceremonies, why not use the money for a business.\r\nThere is no kingdom sense in spending for birthday or burial when you don\'t have any investment. Whatever takes money away from you unnecessarily will bind you to poverty. Some of the money you waste on unnecessary journey can be invested in a nice small-scale business, which will later bring back further wealth to you.\r\nMany people remain poor because they use money carelessly. Money respects helpers and investors. If you are good in helping others, as well goods in re-investing, you can never be bound to poverty! I release the grace on you to help others from your little resources and to always plough back and you will never lack money in Jesus name.\r\nWisdom Lime: (Those who help others and re-invest money\' never go down financially)	\r\nPrayer: Father, grant me the grace to help and to always re-invest.

Her VISA was rejected severally until the LORD told her to forgive her mother-in-law who offended her. As soon as she agreed and forgave her mother-in-law, her VISA was approved and she flew to join her husband abroad, unforgiveness can deny you a lot of favour, when you forgive you commit God to favour you in an unprecedented way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forgiveness also makes you enjoy divine forgiveness. When you easily forgive people, God easily forgives your offenses too. When you find it difficult to forgive, God will also find it difficult to forgive you too. I must conclude with this truth, forgiveness becomes easy when the offender asks for forgiveness. If God does not forgive until we ask him to forgive our trespasses. So when you offend someone, kindly go to the person with all humility and ask him/her to please forgive and God will rant you favour. The manner of your presentation matters. Ask for forgiveness with all remorse and it would be easier for the person you offend to forgive you. Leam to forgive people that ask for it, don\'t be too rigid so God also can forgive you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisdom Lime: (The more you easily forgive, the more God easily forgives you too.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prayer: Father, help me to forgive easily so I can enjoy your forgiveness too.
